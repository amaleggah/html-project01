    <h1>Frida Kahlo's Legacy</h1>
      <p>Frida Kahlo broke down the barriers of femininity. Unbothered by the
        beauty standards of the time, she refused to shave her mustache and
        groom her unibrow. Furthermore, after suffering a brutal automobile
        accident, Frida Kahlo wore a prosthetic leg. </p>
      <p>Frida Kahlo is an important feminist icon because she was not just
        another white woman. She embraced her sexuality as a queer woman; she proudly
        discussed her communist beliefs. Frida Kahlo challenges the notions
        of traditional white feminism. </p>
      <p>Some of her art can be viewed at the website linked

    <h1>Frida Kahlo's Work</h1>
      <p>Frida Kahlo's prolific career included paintings and even films. However,
      she is best known for her self portraits. Personally, my favorite works of
      hers are as follows:
        <ol>
          <li>Henry Ford Hospital (The Flying Bed)</li>
          <li>Girl With Death Mask</li>
          <li>Frida and the Cesarean Operation</li>
      </p>
      <p>Some of Frida Kahlo's latest work includes
        <ul>
          <li>Brick Kilns</li>
          <li>Self Portrait in a Landscape with the Sun Going Down</li>
          <li>Viva la Vida, Watermelons</li>
      </p>
